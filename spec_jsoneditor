PRODUCT: SPREADSHEET JSON FREEFORM EDITOR

Spreadsheet-like editor for arbitrary json tables
  - By default, treats everything at top level
  - Can "expand" nested fields
  - e.g.:
      Suppose there is a "meditation" column, with a "note" and "duration" subfield
      By default, it'll display "meditaiton: [obj]"
      But can expand, to show "meditation.note" and "meditaiton.duration"

Use case:
  - editing lots of objects efficiently
  - "show all Activities tagged Workout", and let me edit it as efficiently as
    I currently edit google docs.
