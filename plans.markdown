HEC gets called with detail object, and a template:

    Meta-template: (anonymous)
      $type: Complex < -- extends?
      $required: [sleep, happiness, productivity]

      sleep:
        $type: Humon.Sleep
      goals:
        $include: List
        $each:
          $goal
      stories:
        best:
          $include: Text
        worst:
          $include: Text
      happiness:
        $type: number
        $min:
      productivity:
        $type: number


TYPEDEF Number
  $min: -infinty
  $max: +infinity

TYPEDEF String
  minLength: 0
  maxLength: 255

TYPEDEF Date


TYPEDEF float
  $extends Number
  $validation: CUSTOM CAN ONLY BE A FLOAT

TYPEDEF Hash
  children
  $each:
    $type: ANYTHING

TYPEDEF Complex
  $include Hash
  $required keys: []


TYPEDEF 1to10Answer
  $type: Integer
  $min:


TYPEDEF Humon.Sleep
  $include: Complex
  $required: [wokeup at, out of bed at]
  wokeup at:
    $type: DateTime
    $display as: "HH:MM"
  energy at wakeup:
    $type: 1to10Answer





So many $TYPE and $INCLUDE do the same thing (pull in a type ref) except $TYPE expicitly sets the
type, wher as $INCLUDE creates an new anonymous meta









### Principle

$type semantics
  OKAY. so TYPE pulls in a TYPE DESCRIPTION to the node at which the TYPE operator is applied.
  $include vs $type
  Everything else there overrides
Principles
  * everything has a canonical text-only representation
  * any node can be put into this mode
  * Separation of display from content

Complex objects
  * graceful fallback -- if no sleep object is defined, then it is just displayed
  as a normal object


Templating
  * manipulation control
  * complex data types
  * structured data types that include arbitrary permissions
  * switch between "object view" and "pretty view" ?

Storing of HN data-templates
  * class Template
      stores a typedef'd template as a bson document

  omg, we can even edit templates via the web interface

typedef Typedef
  !name: "Typedef"
  !key:
  !or:
    $each:
      $type: Typedef

Typedef Taglist
  $each:
    $type: tag

ALGORITHM FOR GENERATING DENORMALIZED TYPE OBJECT
1. Parse along
2. If we encounter a $type key, look up its value
  - if the value is a typedef'd type
    merge in the value of the typedef'd type at the current path
  - continue overriding settings with optiosn provided at the current path
  - Recursively merge in nested $types
  - If the value is a primitive type, then we're done!

===  How is a complex type represented as a HumonNode structure?
e.g., what is inside the nodeVal? does it contain additional child nodes?

=== Difference between complex type (humon node) and complex type display (templating)
I.e., linking up a HumonNodeSleep to a template that isnt?

=== Difference between

=== Case study: date / time objects / time ranges...
  * Want to be flexible about displaying...
  * Helper information ("2 hours ago...")
  * Display as a time
      - 4:30pm
  * Collapse to date
      - Sun, May 12
  * Collapse to date + year
      - Sun, May 12, 2013
  * Joint editing of duration's start and end
      Start: 4:30pm
      End: 5:00pm
      Duration: 30m
  * Aliasing of attributes
    UI looks like
    Sleep:
      time:
        started at: 01:30                  at some point, would like to be able to type "8pm for 8 hours" or "8p-4a"
        ended at:
        duration: 8 hours
      lights off at: 7:45 pm
      asleep at: 8pm
      initial awake up at: 6am
      out of bed at: 7am
      alarm: [
        7:15am
        7:20am
        7:35am
      ]
      slept for: 8 hours

typedef AlarmList
  $collection: true
  $array: true
  $each:
    $type: $alarm

typedef Alarm
  $or: [
    0.
      $type: datetime
      $as: "time"
    1.
      time:
        $type: datetime (or should this just be a time? seconds past midnight?)
      snoozes:
        $collection: true
        $array: true
        $each:
          $type: integer
          $as: "number of minutes"
  ]



  *  as an aside -- difficulty in unifying sleep things.

  Yesterday
    slept at
    awake at
  today
    awake at == yesterday.sleep.ended

==================================================================

== Should server be able to specify the template?
Like, what would be most easy to use in the future?
"Object template" should be straight up JSON
  * includes permissions
  * permissivity
  * optionality


If complex types are essentially just big blobs, how does j2hn know to parse it as a complex type?

### TEMPLATES

details:
  sleep:
    start: 23:00
    end: 07:00
    energy at lights out:

Template operators:
  $type
  $required
  $permit other values (only if this is a collection)
  $path
  $required child attributes

typedef timestamped-object:
  $collection: true
  $permit other values: false
  time stamp:
    $type datetime
    $required true
    $path: this.timestamp
  payload:
    $type anything
    $required optional
    $path: this.payload

typedef taglist
  $collection: true
  $array: true
  $each:
    $type: string
  $each_validates_uniqueness: true

typedef list of list of integers
  $collection: true
  $array: rue
  $each:
    $type:
      $array: true


typedef meal
  time:
    $type: datetime
  name:
    $type: validation



**how to handle enums?**

meta:
  sleep:
    start:
      $type: datetime
      $required: true
    end:
      $type: datetime
      $required: true
    energy at lights out:
      $type: range
      $range start: 0
      $range end: 10
      $path: sleep.energy_at_lights_out
  meals:
    [
      dinner:
        $type: bool
        $path: meals.@each.dinner
      lunch:
        $type: bool
        $path: meals.@each.lunch
      breakfast:
        $type: bool
        $path: meals.@each.breakfast
    ]
  meals:
    [
      $type: meal
      $path: meals.@each
    ]
  list of numbers:
    [
      $type: integer
      $path: list_of_numbers.@each
    ]

#### ALGORITHM
  if an object has a key that starts with $
  THEN it is a metavalue, which DESCRIBES the sets of values that can fit in its path

# IDEA
=======
  typedefed values can contain other values. e.g.,
  TimeRange:
    Start:
    d
      $type: time with zone
    End:
      $type: time with zone







### MVP

* MixPanel een tracking for happiness, productivity, sleepiness

* link up with twilio / email GoogleVoice

* Deploy on EC2


### USE EPICS

* For tracking arbitrary DATUM about your life

    * I want to know how sleepy I am throughout the entire day.

    * I want to keep track of what I’m eating for each meal

    * I want the tracking to be SEAMLESS and FAST

        * I don’t want to spend more than 15 minutes a day tracking TOTAL, and that’s tracking a LOT of stuff

* For analyzing the things you tracked

    * I want to know how my sleep hygiene affects my productivity, as measured by the following properties

    * I want to know how many apples I ate in June

* For figuring out how I spend my time (cross RescueTime)

    * how productive am I?

    * How much time and

* For documenting what I do

    * I want journal my best part of day

        * worst part of day

        * funny stories

        * big ideas

* For automatically importing your data from other sources

    * Music -- what songs am I listening to?

        * How has my music listening changed over time?

    * Location

    * Evernotes -- notes created

    * Email

    * Github

    * RescueTime

* For serving as a motivating force -- think of gamifying it via [https://github.com/samsquire/ideas/tree/1c62a7115e63c4b2fc3380e138bf3dac2a81d979#71-gaming-interfaces-for-work](https://github.com/samsquire/ideas/tree/1c62a7115e63c4b2fc3380e138bf3dac2a81d979#71-gaming-interfaces-for-work)

    * Your producitvity right now

    * Your "focus"

    * Number of distractions

* For providing an "at-a-glance" view of my life / one-stop dashboard for all things that matter to my life

**FEATURES**

* sends you a text every 30 minutes asking you to track

* lets you reply to the text with a simple format to be parsed

* **REMINDERS**

* Templates -- auto insert the template for whatever you’re supposed to be tracking

    * df

* "grab" paths e.g. meals.breakfast.ate?, moods.happiness,

* Notifies me when

* Timeline view

    * like facebook

    * show gaps between SP acts

        * "4 hours untracked" -- click to track an act

    * by default, zoom to the current day

    * can scroll to see previous.

**Architecture / data model / processes**

* **Reminders**

    * A "response" to a reminder is a specific recording to a requested tracking

        * aka, system that I set up requests me to track property P

        * When I get the reminder, I "respond" by tracking property P

    * instantaneous (timestamped) or duration?

    * integrated to sherwin points data?

* **Templates**

    * Goal is to **keep the data as normalized as possible**

        * Use case:

            * Month 1, I track "ate_breakfast: bool"

            * Later on, I namespace these under

                * meals.breakfast:meal_object

* ‘Event’ architecture

    * Are we going to support generic event tracking? MixPanel style?

**PHILOSOPHY**

* time-stamped (instantaneous tracking) vs duration

    * timestamp: at 2pm today, I felt 10 happy

    * duration: between 2 and 2:30 today, I felt 10 happy

### Goals

* clean up humon node editor  to the point that:

    * streamline event architecture for humon node

    * reliable editing

        * tests

        * humon node parses correctly (no more invisible errors becaus HUMON parser fails)

    * in place ‘large’ edit

    * multiple data types

        * good date editing

    * sane defaults for new node

    * for this week: only track at the day level

* then

    * think about how to propagate templates from server to client

    * how to reliably include meta information

    * how to make the humon node editor a plug and play json editor

* then

    * hour to hour tracking

* api

    * **temporary finalize backend structure**

        * **how are activities / days stored?**

        * **nesting**

        * **aggregation and bubbling **

    * allow posting both from the dashboard and from the chrome extension

* chrome extension

    * track detailed site usage

* dashboard

    * allower arbitrary tracking

    * reminder via a chrome extension

    * prominently display active goals

        * tag activities to goals

Support for goals

* inputting weekly goals

* inputting longer goals

* **inputting daily plans**

    * **want style of**

    * **2-4pm: do x y z**

    * **4-5pm: do x y z**

        * **and do x yz **

        * **comments**

* **but want it to be stored in HUMON NODE format.**

    * data modeling. one of :

        * stand alone plans (each entity has its own barries, no relation to each other)

        * nested under a ‘day’

        * nested under the ‘plan’ field of the SPday object

            * coerced to a ‘template’ ?

            * or a ‘type’?

        * a whole other object by itself

    * approaches

        * time boundaries stored natively against metadata

* HNV / act extensions via ```partial```

ACT can have many child entities

	some entities are plans

	some entities are other acts

think about client / server communications -- embedding vs not embedded

data modeling is independent of UI display

	Figure out data model first. don’t be lazy.

Entity

	start time

	end time

	description

	details





Plan < Entity

Goal < Plan

Habit < Plan



Act < Entity



Day < Act

Do we even need an explicit details object?.... probably not?
