    Humon.LabelledField label="Goal" content=goalJson.description
    Common usecases
      1 -- displaying labelled information
      2 -- allowing editable information
      3 -- free editable information (includes type changes)
      4 -- variable types

  Humon.ImmutableField
  Humon.Field can probably be drastically simplified -- all it needs is to be extensible
    but limited to the domain of literals.
    so can support formatting, validations, field-specific-hotkeys, etc.
    Which of these
  Eventually, Humon.NodeView template can utilize Humon.Field as well
    instead of such tight coupling with the underlying ContentFields
    So this also implies the interface is almost definitely going to be json only
